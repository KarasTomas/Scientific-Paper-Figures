## **I. Introduction: Elevating Scientific Communication with Python Figures**

Scientific figures serve as the cornerstone of effective research communication, enabling the clear and succinct representation of complex data and discoveries.1 In the realm of mechanical engineering, where precise quantitative analysis and material behavior characterization are paramount, high-quality figures are indispensable. They facilitate improved decision-making and teamwork by transforming intricate information into engaging and memorable visual narratives.1 For figures to fulfill this critical role, they must be clear, easy to read, and produced with the highest possible quality and resolution.2 Furthermore, they should be self-contained, meaning they are understandable without extensive reference to the main text, with captions providing a concise yet complete explanation of the presented data.3

This report outlines the development of a GitHub repository dedicated to Python-based templates for scientific figures, specifically tailored for mechanical engineering applications, with a particular emphasis on strength of materials. The primary objective of this resource is to streamline the generation of publication-ready plots, ensuring both visual consistency and adherence to established best practices in scientific visualization.

The Python ecosystem, particularly with its Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries, offers a robust framework for scientific graphics. Matplotlib, as the foundational plotting library, provides extensive customization capabilities, allowing for granular control over every element of a figure.5 Building upon this foundation, Seaborn offers higher-level interfaces designed for statistical plotting, significantly enhancing the aesthetic appeal and simplifying the creation of complex visualizations.7 The synergistic combination of these two libraries enables both fine-grained control and the rapid generation of visually appealing and consistent plots, critical for academic and industrial applications.9

The inspiration for this project stems from existing resources, such as the AndreyChurkin/BeautifulFigures repository. However, a notable limitation of such existing templates, particularly those primarily MATLAB-based, often lies in their "limited template structure".10 This project directly addresses this concern by translating the aesthetic quality and scientific rigor observed in such figures into a more extensible and Pythonic framework. The approach leverages Matplotlib's

.mplstyle files and Seaborn's set\_theme function, which offer a systematic and programmatic method to enforce consistent visual styles across an entire research project or publication. Unlike individual scripts that might require manual adjustments for each plot, leading to inconsistencies, .mplstyle files are declarative configuration files that define a comprehensive set of Matplotlib runtime parameters (rcParams).11 Once created, a custom style can be applied with a single line of code (

plt.style.use('my\_style')), instantly transforming all subsequent plots to adhere to that predefined theme.5 Seaborn's

set\_theme provides similar global control by internally leveraging rcParams.7 This architectural improvement moves beyond isolated scripts to a centralized, reusable styling system, greatly enhancing reproducibility and reducing manual effort in figure generation.

## **II. Foundational Principles of Effective Scientific Data Visualization**

Effective scientific figures are not merely decorative elements; they are powerful tools for conveying complex information accurately and efficiently. Adhering to fundamental principles of data visualization is crucial to ensure that figures serve their intended purpose.

### **Clarity and Simplicity: The "Less is More" Philosophy**

The core tenet of effective scientific figures is clarity and simplicity, ensuring that the intended message is easily understood by the audience.1 This philosophy, often summarized as "Less is more," emphasizes the removal of all non-essential elements to allow the data to stand out prominently.12

A common pitfall in scientific visualization is the inclusion of "chartjunk" – unnecessary decorative elements that detract from the data.1 This includes excessive backgrounds, distracting borders, gratuitous shading, overly dark grid lines, and superfluous labels.12 Such elements contribute "non-data-ink" or "redundant data-ink," which, rather than adding information, merely creates visual clutter and confuses the audience.12 In mechanical engineering, where precise quantitative comparisons are frequently critical—for instance, when comparing material strengths or analyzing stress distributions—violating this principle by introducing chartjunk directly compromises the interpretability and accuracy of the engineering analysis presented. The visual noise from such clutter increases the cognitive load on the viewer, making it harder and slower to extract exact values, slopes, or relative magnitudes essential for design decisions or failure analysis.

Furthermore, the use of three-dimensional (3D) effects should generally be avoided unless a third dimension is explicitly being plotted and conveys meaningful data.1 In most cases, 3D elements are purely decorative, disorienting the viewer and distorting the data, thereby making accurate comparisons significantly more challenging.12 For example, a 3D bar chart can make it difficult to ascertain the true height of bars against an axis, as the perspective can skew perceived values. Such misleading visual representations can lead to incorrect conclusions about material performance or structural behavior, potentially resulting in design flaws or misinterpretations of experimental data. In engineering, where figures often directly inform critical design and safety decisions, a figure that is difficult to interpret or, worse, misleading, can have significant real-world consequences, from suboptimal material selection to structural failures. Thus, simplicity and clarity are not merely aesthetic preferences but fundamental requirements for reliable engineering communication.

### **Purposeful Use of Color and Avoiding Misrepresentation**

Color in scientific figures should serve a clear communicative purpose, rather than being used for mere decoration.1 An excessive number of colors can overwhelm the audience, leading to confusion and blurring the intended message.12 When a color deviates from the norm, the human eye naturally pays attention, and the brain attempts to assign meaning to that difference. Too many such differences dilute the message and can disorient the viewer.12

It is also imperative to ensure that chosen colors are distinct and accessible to all users, including individuals with colorblindness.1 To address accessibility concerns, varying the intensity of a single hue or incorporating additional visual cues such as symbols or numbers can significantly improve readability for colorblind readers.12 The principle suggests admitting colors into charts "gracefully," as one would welcome in-laws into their home, indicating a thoughtful and restrained approach.12

### **Appropriate Precision and Thoughtful Text Annotation**

Overstating numerical precision by including too many decimal places can create a false impression of accuracy while often being pointless or even misleading.12 The level of precision displayed should always align with the communication objectives and the needs of the readers.12 If less precision is used than is available in the raw data, it is important to inform the audience.12

Text annotations, including chart titles, axis titles, axis labels, units of measurement, and data sources, are crucial for providing context and highlighting key insights.1 These textual elements help readers understand the data without having to struggle with the chart itself, guiding their interpretation of the presented information.12 While text is vital, it should enhance, not hijack, attention from the data itself.12

## **III. Core Python Libraries for Scientific Plotting**

The Python ecosystem offers powerful libraries for scientific plotting, with Matplotlib and Seaborn standing out as foundational tools for creating high-quality figures.

### **Matplotlib: The Foundation for Customization**

Matplotlib serves as the bedrock of Python plotting, providing comprehensive and granular control over virtually every element of a figure.5 This extensive control allows users to apply predefined themes or to develop and implement highly customized styles. Styles can be activated using

plt.style.use() for global application or plt.style.context() for temporary application within a specific code block.5

At its core, Matplotlib utilizes a runtime configuration (rcParams) system that defines the default styles for all plot elements.6 This configuration can be adjusted at any time, either globally for an entire session or temporarily for specific plots. The ability to modify

rcParams is fundamental for achieving consistent aesthetics across multiple plots within a publication or project.9 By centralizing these aesthetic decisions, Matplotlib enables researchers to enforce a uniform visual identity across all their generated figures.

### **Seaborn: Enhancing Aesthetics and Statistical Plots**

Seaborn is a higher-level library built on top of Matplotlib, renowned for its aesthetically pleasing default styles and its specialized functions for statistical data visualization.8 It simplifies the creation of complex statistical plots and offers a range of built-in themes, including

darkgrid, whitegrid, dark, white, and ticks, which can be applied using sns.set\_style().8

Beyond basic style settings, the seaborn.set\_theme() function provides a comprehensive mechanism for configuring the visual theme of all Matplotlib and Seaborn plots.7 This function allows control over various aspects such as the plotting context (e.g.,

notebook, paper), the axes style, the color palette, font properties, and even custom rcParams overrides.7 This flexibility ensures that figures can be precisely tailored to meet specific aesthetic and publication requirements.

### **Synergy Between Matplotlib and Seaborn for Advanced Control**

The true power of Python for scientific plotting emerges from the synergy between Matplotlib and Seaborn. Seaborn functions often return underlying Matplotlib Figure and Axes objects, providing users with the flexibility to combine Seaborn's high-level aesthetic enhancements with Matplotlib's fine-grained customization capabilities.15 This integration is essential for creating highly customized, publication-quality figures that adhere to specific scientific and engineering conventions.

The interplay between Matplotlib's rcParams and Seaborn's theme functions allows for a sophisticated, layered approach to figure styling. This enables users to build highly specific "house styles" that extend beyond simple pre-defined themes. For instance, a base .mplstyle file can define fundamental publication aesthetics, such as the font family, default line widths, and grid visibility.11 Subsequently,

seaborn.set\_theme() can be employed to layer on specific color palettes or context settings, potentially overriding some rcParams from the base style.7 Finally, individual plot elements can be tweaked directly on the

Axes objects for unique cases or specific emphasis. This layered control is particularly valuable for researchers who need to adhere to stringent journal guidelines or institutional branding for their figures. A university or research group can develop a custom .mplstyle file to enforce its "house style," which can then be easily adopted by all researchers within the organization. This ensures visual consistency across all publications and presentations, enhancing the collective professional image and addressing reproducibility and consistency at an organizational level, not just an individual one.

## **IV. Customizing Figure Aesthetics: Colors and Fonts**

The aesthetic quality of scientific figures, particularly the thoughtful application of colors and fonts, significantly impacts their readability, accessibility, and overall professional appearance.

### **A. Custom Color Styling for Scientific Figures**

The selection of color palettes for scientific figures must prioritize accessibility for individuals with colorblindness and low vision.16 Colors should be sufficiently distinct to allow clear differentiation between data points. To further enhance readability for all users, direct labeling, varying color intensities, or incorporating additional visual cues such as symbols or numbers are recommended.12 For figures with fewer than 14 data points, employing single-hue palettes can reduce high contrast, which may be overstimulating for neurodivergent individuals.16 Tools such as Chroma.js Color Palette Helper and Viz Palette are valuable resources for generating and fine-tuning colorblind-safe palettes, providing visual simulations of how colors appear in grayscale.16

The choice of color palette type—qualitative, sequential, or diverging—is dictated by the nature of the data being represented.17

* **Qualitative palettes** are appropriate for categorical variables, such as different material types or experimental conditions, where there is no inherent order among the categories. The colors in a qualitative palette must be distinct, and it is generally advisable to limit the palette size to ten or fewer colors to prevent confusion.17  
* **Sequential palettes** are designed for numeric or inherently ordered values, such as increasing stress levels or temperature gradients. In these palettes, lightness is the most prominent dimension, with lower values typically represented by lighter colors and higher values by darker colors, especially on a light background. While a single hue can be used, spanning between two hues can provide additional encoding assistance.17  
* **Diverging palettes** are best suited for numeric variables that possess a meaningful central value, such as zero stress or deviations from a target. These palettes combine two sequential palettes, each with a distinctive hue, sharing a light central endpoint. Darker colors indicate a greater distance from the central value, allowing for clear differentiation between positive and negative deviations.17

The selection of color palette type is not merely an aesthetic choice in mechanical engineering figures but a critical decision that directly impacts the accuracy and ease of interpretation of material behavior and performance. Mechanical engineering data frequently involves distinct categories (e.g., different alloys, processing routes), ordered numerical values (e.g., increasing load, temperature), or values diverging from a neutral point (e.g., tensile versus compressive stress, positive/negative strain). Using a qualitative palette for sequential data, for instance, would incorrectly imply discrete, unordered categories, making it difficult to perceive trends or magnitudes. Conversely, applying a sequential palette to categorical data would erroneously suggest an inherent order or magnitude relationship between categories. For example, a sequential palette with varying lightness effectively communicates increasing stress or temperature in a heatmap. A diverging palette is essential for visualizing stress states where both tension (positive) and compression (negative) are present, with a clear neutral point. Misusing these palettes can lead to misinterpretation of critical engineering phenomena like yield, fracture, or stress concentrations. In fields like strength of materials, misinterpreting data due to poor color choices could lead to flawed material selection, incorrect stress analysis, or unsafe designs. Therefore, understanding and correctly applying qualitative, sequential, and diverging palettes is a fundamental skill for accurate engineering visualization.

Custom color palettes can be implemented in Matplotlib and Seaborn. Matplotlib's rcParams\['axes.prop\_cycle'\] can be configured with cycler to define custom color cycles.6 Seaborn offers

sns.set\_theme(palette='custom\_palette\_name') or sns.set\_palette() to set color palettes, allowing custom palettes to be passed as a list of color codes (e.g., Hex codes).7

**Table 1: Recommended Color Palette Types and Use Cases for Mechanical Engineering Data**

| Palette Type | Description | Typical Mechanical Engineering Use Cases | Recommended Seaborn/Matplotlib Functions | Key Considerations |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Qualitative** | For distinct, unordered categories. Colors should be easily distinguishable. | Comparing different material compositions (e.g., steel vs. aluminum vs. composites), various heat treatment processes, distinct failure modes, or different experimental setups. | sns.color\_palette("Set1"), sns.color\_palette("Paired"), plt.cm.tab10 | Limit to ≤10 colors; ensure colorblind-safety; use symbols/labels for redundancy. |
| **Sequential** | For numeric or ordered values, showing progression from low to high. Typically varies in lightness and/or saturation. | Visualizing increasing load, temperature gradients, stress magnitude distributions, material degradation over time, or strain energy accumulation. | sns.color\_palette("viridis"), sns.color\_palette("magma"), plt.cm.Greys | Lightness as primary differentiator; consider single vs. dual hue; suitable for continuous data. |
| **Diverging** | For numeric values with a meaningful central point (e.g., zero), showing deviations in two directions. Uses two distinct hues. | Representing tensile (positive) vs. compressive (negative) stress, positive vs. negative strain, deviation from a target value, or changes around a baseline. | sns.color\_palette("coolwarm"), sns.color\_palette("RdBu"), plt.cm.seismic | Clear central (light) color; distinct hues for positive/negative; darker colors indicate greater magnitude. |

### **B. Optimal Font Selection for Readability and Professionalism**

For scientific figures, sans-serif fonts such as Arial, Helvetica, and Calibri are highly recommended due to their superior readability, particularly when rendered at small sizes and used for labels and legends.19 Leading scientific journals like

*Nature*, *Science*, and *Cell* specifically request Helvetica for figure captions, underscoring its acceptance as a professional standard.19

Ensuring consistent font sizes and styles across all figures is crucial for maintaining a professional appearance.20 Figures should ideally employ no more than three distinct font sizes to preserve visual consistency.20 While font sizes should generally not be smaller than 5 points within figures, 8 points is frequently recommended for figure legends, and a range of 8-14 points is suitable for longer text blocks.19 It is advisable to avoid using all capital letters (ALL CAPS) or artistic/script fonts, as these choices can significantly hinder readability in a scientific context.19

The choice and consistent application of fonts in scientific figures, particularly in mechanical engineering, significantly impacts the perceived credibility and professionalism of the research. This, in turn, influences how readily findings are accepted and trusted by the broader scientific community. Readability is paramount; fonts that are too small, inconsistent, or overly decorative force the reader to expend more cognitive effort on decoding text rather than understanding the data, creating unnecessary friction. Adhering to the font standards set by top-tier journals signals that the researcher understands and respects the conventions of scientific communication. Conversely, using inappropriate fonts or inconsistent sizing can subtly undermine the perceived rigor of the work. In mechanical engineering, where designs and analyses must be robust and reliable, figures that appear unprofessional or difficult to read can lead to a subconscious distrust in the underlying data or methodology. If the presentation appears sloppy, it can inadvertently suggest a lack of rigor in the research itself. For PhD researchers, the quality of figures is a direct factor in the success of peer review and publication, as clear, consistent, and professionally formatted figures enhance the reviewer's experience, making the paper easier to understand and more likely to be accepted. This highlights that font selection is not merely an aesthetic detail but a strategic component of academic success.

Custom fonts can be applied globally using Matplotlib's matplotlib.rcParams\['font.family'\] setting.14 For figures containing equations, especially in LaTeX-based publications, the serif "Computer Modern" font (the default LaTeX font) is recommended for consistency and proper rendering.20 A highly effective method for managing comprehensive font configurations (including font family, size for titles, labels, ticks, and legends) across multiple plots is to create custom

.mplstyle files.5 These plain text files define a set of

rcParams settings, allowing for easy and consistent application of a unified theme to all figures.11

## **V. Standard Plot Types and Conventions in Mechanical Engineering (Strength of Materials)**

Mechanical engineering, particularly within the domain of strength of materials, relies on a specific set of plot types and conventions to effectively communicate material behavior and structural response. Adhering to these conventions ensures clarity, accuracy, and comparability of results.

### **A. Stress-Strain Curves**

Stress-strain curves are fundamental graphical measures of a material's mechanical properties, illustrating the relationship between stress (force per unit area) on the y-axis and strain (deformation per original length) on the x-axis.21

Two primary types of stress-strain curves are commonly employed:

* **Engineering Stress-Strain Curves** utilize the initial dimensions of the specimen for stress and strain calculations. These curves are widely used, particularly for ductile materials, up to their ultimate tensile strength.23  
* **True Stress-Strain Curves** account for the instantaneous cross-sectional area and incremental strain during deformation. This provides a more direct and accurate measure of the material's response, especially in the plastic flow range and beyond necking.23

For true stress-strain data, especially when characterizing strain hardening behavior, **log-log scaling** is often essential.23 This scaling can linearize relationships that appear non-linear on a linear scale, thereby revealing underlying material behavior and facilitating the determination of parameters like the strain hardening exponent.22 The convention of plotting stress-strain curves on both linear and log-log scales allows engineers to extract different, yet complementary, insights into material behavior. Linear plots clearly highlight elastic and macroscopic plastic deformation, providing direct, easily interpretable values for initial design considerations and understanding basic material response. Log-log plots, conversely, are crucial for characterizing strain hardening and predicting material response under severe deformation, directly informing constitutive models used in simulations. A linear plot might show a material fracturing shortly after yielding, but a log-log true stress-strain curve could reveal significant strain hardening capacity even after the engineering stress peaks. This deeper understanding of post-yield behavior is vital for applications involving large deformations, such as forming operations or crashworthiness. The ability to accurately characterize strain hardening from log-log plots provides critical input for constitutive material models used in finite element analysis (FEA), which predict how materials will behave under complex loading conditions. This is essential for advanced mechanical design and failure prediction; without the insights from log-log plots, these models would be less accurate, leading to potentially unreliable simulations and designs.

Key points typically identified on stress-strain curves include:

* **Linear Elastic Region**: In this initial stage, stress is directly proportional to strain, and the slope of this linear region is defined as Young's Modulus, representing the material's stiffness.21  
* **Yield Strength (Sty)**: This is the stress value at which plastic (permanent) deformation begins. It is often determined by an offset method, such as the 0.2% offset yield strength.22  
* **Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS)**: Represents the maximum stress that the material can sustain before necking or fracture initiates.22  
* **Necking Region**: Beyond the UTS, localized reduction in cross-sectional area (necking) occurs, leading to a decrease in engineering stress despite increasing true stress.26  
* **Fracture Stress**: The stress at which the material ultimately breaks.22

### **B. Fatigue (S-N) Diagrams**

Fatigue is a critical failure mechanism in mechanical components subjected to cyclic loading. S-N (Stress-Number of cycles) curves are empirical tools used to quantify and design against fatigue failure.32 These diagrams typically plot stress amplitude (S) on the y-axis against the number of cycles to failure (N) on the x-axis, with the N-axis often presented on a logarithmic scale to accommodate the wide range of cycle counts.32

A significant convention observed in S-N curves for certain materials, particularly ferrous alloys, is the presence of an "endurance limit".32 Below this stress amplitude, the material is theoretically expected not to fail due to fatigue, regardless of the number of load cycles. Due to the inherent statistical variability and considerable scatter observed in fatigue life data, it is often necessary to test a large number of specimens at various load levels to define the S-N curve with sufficient statistical confidence.32 The inherent randomness and considerable scatter in fatigue life data necessitate that S-N diagrams are interpreted not as deterministic curves but as probabilistic representations. This means a single S-N curve is an average or median representation, not a guarantee of performance. The scatter implies that even at a given stress level, the number of cycles to failure can vary widely. For engineers, this shifts the design paradigm from a purely deterministic "this material will last X cycles at Y stress" to a probabilistic "this material has a Z% probability of lasting X cycles at Y stress." This necessitates the incorporation of statistical analysis, reliability engineering, and appropriate factors of safety to ensure acceptable failure probabilities in critical components. In high-consequence mechanical engineering applications, understanding and accounting for fatigue scatter is paramount for risk management and ensuring structural integrity over the product's lifespan. Ignoring this variability, or presenting S-N data deterministically, could lead to catastrophic failures.

### **C. Ashby Plots (Material Selection Charts)**

Ashby plots, also known as material selection charts, are powerful scatter plots that visually compare two or more properties of various materials or classes of materials.22 They serve as a novel graphical method for presenting material property data, significantly simplifying the complex material selection process by providing a visual overview of trade-offs.34

Given that most mechanical characteristics span several orders of magnitude, logarithmic scales are essential for both axes of Ashby plots.22 Common axes pairings include Young's modulus versus density (for stiffness and lightness) or strength versus density (for strength-to-weight ratio).30 A key feature of Ashby plots is the ability to plot "performance indices" – derived equations that numerically quantify how desirable a material is for a specific design situation.22 These performance indices often appear as straight lines on the log-log chart, and by convention, a higher intercept of this line indicates better material performance for the given design objective.22

The use of log-log scaling and performance index lines on Ashby plots transforms a simple material property comparison into a powerful visual optimization tool for mechanical design. This allows engineers to quickly identify optimal materials based on complex, multi-property trade-offs, such as needing a material that is both stiff and light. The fact that many material properties span "several orders of magnitude" makes linear plots impractical. Log-log scaling compresses this range, making it possible to visualize a vast array of materials on a single chart. Critically, performance indices often become straight lines on a log-log plot. These straight lines act as "selection lines." By moving a performance index line across the chart, an engineer can visually identify which material families or specific materials fall above the line, indicating superior performance for the defined design objective. This provides a rapid, intuitive way to perform multi-criteria optimization. Ashby plots enable engineers to quickly explore the material design space, identify novel material candidates (e.g., foams, technical ceramics for bending), and make informed trade-offs early in the design process. This accelerates innovation and improves design efficiency by moving beyond simple property look-ups to a sophisticated, visual decision-making framework.

### **D. Heatmaps for Material Properties**

Heatmaps are a versatile visualization tool that depict values for a main variable across two axis variables as a grid of colored squares.37 In mechanical engineering and materials science, heatmaps are particularly useful for visualizing correlations between various parameters, such as chemical elements and mechanical properties like Yield Strength (YS) and Tensile Strength (TS) of alloys.39 They can also illustrate the distribution of properties across different material types, processing conditions, or experimental results.35

Best practices for creating effective heatmaps include:

* **Appropriate Color Palette**: Selecting a color palette that is suitable for the data type is crucial. Sequential or diverging palettes are generally well-suited for quantitative property data.17  
* **Clear Legend**: A legend is essential for interpreting the mapping between colors and data values.37  
* **Value Annotation**: Where precision is critical, displaying the exact numerical values within the cells can supplement the color mapping, as color alone may lack sufficient precision for exact comparisons.37  
* **Sorting**: For categorical axes, sorting levels by similarity or value can help reveal underlying patterns in the data.37  
* **Tick Marks**: Selecting useful and uncluttered tick marks is important, especially for numeric axes with many bins.37

Heatmaps, particularly correlation heatmaps of material properties, are not just descriptive visualizations but are becoming integral to predictive materials science and data-driven material design. They enable rapid identification of key compositional or processing parameters that strongly influence desired mechanical properties, thereby guiding experimental and computational efforts. Modern materials science often involves high-dimensional data, such as the influence of multiple alloying elements on various mechanical properties. Traditional plots struggle to show these multi-variable relationships clearly. Heatmaps excel at visualizing correlation matrices, color-coding correlation strength to immediately highlight which input variables (e.g., chemical elements) have the strongest positive or negative relationships with output properties (e.g., Yield Strength, Tensile Strength).39 This direct link demonstrates how heatmaps inform feature selection for machine learning models, leading to improved predictive accuracy in material design. This application moves beyond simply presenting data to actively guiding research, accelerating the iterative process of materials discovery and optimization, reducing the need for extensive trial-and-error experiments, and enabling more targeted computational simulations.

### **E. Bar Charts for Material Comparisons**

Bar charts are highly effective for comparing discrete numerical values across different categories.1 In mechanical engineering, they are frequently employed to compare properties such as strength, hardness, stiffness, or other performance metrics across various materials, processing conditions, or design iterations.31

A critical best practice for bar charts, and one that must be strictly adhered to, is that the bars *must* originate from a zero baseline.12 Truncating the y-axis (i.e., starting it above zero) fundamentally misrepresents the differences between values and can severely mislead the audience by exaggerating perceived variations.12 For instance, if Material A has a yield strength of 500 MPa and Material B has 520 MPa, a truncated bar chart might visually suggest Material B is twice as strong, when in reality it is only 4% stronger. This visual misrepresentation can lead to incorrect decisions in material selection, potentially resulting in suboptimal or unsafe designs. "Truncation equals misrepresentation" 12 is particularly impactful in a field where quantitative accuracy is paramount. Adhering to the zero-baseline rule is thus an ethical imperative in scientific and engineering visualization, ensuring that the visual representation faithfully reflects the underlying data and does not inadvertently (or intentionally) mislead decision-makers.

Other best practices for bar charts include clearly labeling all axes, maintaining consistent colors across bars (or using color purposefully to distinguish categories), and ensuring that the number of bars does not overwhelm the chart.43 Sorting the bars, either in ascending or descending order, can also significantly aid in identifying ranks and patterns within the data.43

## **VI. Advanced Plotting Techniques for Complex Data**

For representing complex datasets and facilitating comparative analysis, advanced plotting techniques such as structured subplots and unified legends are indispensable.

### **A. Subplot Creation and Layout**

Creating multi-panel figures, often referred to as "small multiples" or "trellis plots," is a powerful approach for exploring multi-dimensional data by displaying multiple instances of the same plot on different subsets of a dataset.15 Python's Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries offer several methods for achieving this:

* plt.subplots(): This is the most common and convenient function for simultaneously creating a figure and a grid of subplots. It returns both the Figure object and an array of Axes objects, making it straightforward to manage individual plots within the grid.45  
* matplotlib.gridspec.GridSpec: For more intricate and flexible subplot layouts, GridSpec allows for the creation of subplots with varying sizes or those that span multiple rows or columns within a grid.46 This is useful when certain plots require more visual real estate than others.  
* seaborn.FacetGrid: Specifically designed for "small multiples," FacetGrid simplifies the visualization of distributions or relationships within subsets of a dataset by arranging plots across rows, columns, or by color (hue).15 It automates much of the underlying Matplotlib grid setup, making it highly efficient for statistical comparisons.

Achieving consistent scaling and alignment across subplots is critical for direct visual comparison. The sharex and sharey parameters in plt.subplots() are instrumental for this purpose.45 Setting these parameters to

True or 'all' ensures that all subplots share identical x or y axis limits, while 'row' or 'col' enables sharing within rows or columns, respectively.45

FacetGrid inherently supports consistent scaling across its facets by default, and specific limits can be enforced across all subplots using g.set(xlim=..., ylim=...).15

The strategic use of sharex/sharey in plt.subplots() and the inherent consistent scaling of FacetGrid are not just conveniences; they are critical for enabling direct and accurate visual comparison of trends or distributions across different experimental conditions or material variants in mechanical engineering. Mechanical engineers frequently need to compare material or structural behavior under varying conditions (e.g., stress-strain curves at different temperatures, fatigue life for different surface treatments). If subplots maintain independent axis limits, visual comparison becomes unreliable, as a small change in data might appear significant on a tightly scaled axis, while a large change might appear minor on a broadly scaled one. This can lead to misinterpretations of relative performance. Shared axes force all subplots to use the same scale, making direct visual comparison of slopes, magnitudes, and trends immediate and accurate. For instance, comparing the elastic regions of stress-strain curves for different materials is much clearer if the axes are consistently scaled. FacetGrid's design for "small multiples" inherently supports this, as its core idea is to compare variations across subsets using a consistent visual grammar. This consistency allows researchers to draw more robust and defensible conclusions from their multi-panel figures, transforming a collection of individual plots into a coherent visual argument, essential for high-impact scientific publications.

When axes are shared, only the tick labels of the bottom-most subplot (for the x-axis) or the left-most subplot (for the y-axis) are typically displayed to reduce redundancy and declutter the figure, while still maintaining comparability across panels.45

### **B. Shared Legends and Annotations**

For multi-plot figures, particularly those generated with FacetGrid using a hue variable, Seaborn automatically manages a single, shared legend for the entire grid via g.add\_legend().15 This approach prevents redundant legends on each individual subplot, ensuring consistent color mapping and clear interpretation across all panels. For Matplotlib-only subplots, manual legend placement (e.g., using

ax.legend(loc='outside', bbox\_to\_anchor=(x,y))) and careful figure resizing may be required to achieve a similar unified appearance.52

Effective use of annotations, titles, and labels is crucial for providing context and highlighting key insights within figures.1 These textual elements make the data more relatable and guide the viewer's attention to the most important aspects of the visualization.1

FacetGrid offers specialized methods like FacetGrid.set\_axis\_labels() and FacetGrid.set\_titles() to efficiently manage labels and titles across multiple facets.48

Implementing shared legends and strategic annotations in multi-panel mechanical engineering figures is crucial for establishing narrative cohesion and directing the reader's interpretation of complex, multi-variable relationships. Multi-panel figures are common in mechanical engineering to show different aspects of a single phenomenon or compare multiple conditions. Without shared legends, each panel might have its own legend, leading to redundancy and visual clutter, especially if the same categories or series are plotted across panels. A single, shared legend provides a unified key for all panels, immediately clarifying what each color or line style represents across the entire figure. This significantly reduces cognitive load and allows the reader to focus on the data variations rather than decoding redundant legends. Annotations go beyond basic labels by drawing attention to specific data points, highlighting trends, or explaining anomalies. For example, annotating a yield point on a stress-strain curve or indicating a critical stress concentration on a heatmap can guide the reader's interpretation towards the most important engineering insights. In scientific communication, figures should "tell a story".1 Shared legends provide the consistent "characters" in that story, while annotations are the "narrator's voice," guiding the reader through the data and emphasizing the key findings. This enhances the impact and memorability of the presented research.

## **VII. Structuring the GitHub Repository for Templates**

A well-organized and intuitive GitHub repository structure is paramount for the usability, maintainability, and extensibility of a scientific figure template library.

A recommended file organization for the repository is as follows:

* README.md: This file should provide a comprehensive overview of the repository, including clear installation instructions for dependencies, a detailed usage guide for the templates, and guidelines for potential contributions.  
* styles/: This directory will house custom Matplotlib .mplstyle files.5 These files will define global aesthetic themes, encompassing settings for fonts, colors, line styles, and grid configurations, ensuring a consistent visual identity across all generated plots.  
* templates/: This directory will contain modular Python scripts (.py files) for each specific plot type (e.g., scatter, line, log-scale line, heatmap, bar charts) and common subplot layouts. Each script should encapsulate the plotting logic within a Python function, designed to accept data and relevant plotting parameters (e.g., axis labels, titles, specific colors, log scales) as arguments. These functions should leverage the custom .mplstyle files by using plt.style.use() or with plt.style.context() to consistently apply the predefined themes.6  
* examples/: A Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) will reside here, serving as a comprehensive demonstration of how to use each template script and apply the various styles \[User Query\]. This notebook will provide clear, runnable code examples for users to quickly understand and adapt the templates to their own data.  
* data/: A placeholder directory for sample data used in the examples. Including sample data ensures that all examples are immediately reproducible by anyone cloning the repository.

The combination of .mplstyle files for consistent styling, modular Python functions for plot generation, and a comprehensive Jupyter notebook for examples creates a reproducible research workflow that extends beyond just generating "beautiful figures" to promoting good scientific practice. The user's query for "scientific figure templates" implies a need not just for aesthetically pleasing figures but also for figures that are easy to generate, modify, and reproduce. Encapsulating plotting logic in Python functions within the templates/ directory makes them reusable across different datasets and projects, a superior approach to isolated scripts that might require significant manual adaptation. The styles/ directory centralizes all aesthetic decisions, allowing any change to the "house style" (e.g., a new font size, a different color palette) to be made in one place and instantly propagated to all figures generated using that style. This directly addresses the "limited template structure" concern by providing a powerful, programmatic templating system. The Jupyter notebook in examples/ functions as living documentation, enabling researchers to run the code, visualize the outputs, and modify parameters interactively. This lowers the barrier to entry for new users and facilitates rapid prototyping and customization. This structured approach fosters open science by making figures easily reproducible by others. Collaborators can quickly adopt the same styling, ensuring visual consistency across a team's publications. This transforms the repository from a simple collection of scripts into a valuable tool for enhancing scientific rigor and collaboration in mechanical engineering research.

## **VIII. Conclusion: Towards Reproducible and Visually Impactful Scientific Figures**

The effective communication of research findings in mechanical engineering fundamentally relies on high-quality, clear, and accurate figures. These visual aids are not merely supplementary but are integral to conveying complex data, facilitating precise analysis, and supporting robust conclusions. The proposed Python-based GitHub repository offers a comprehensive solution for generating publication-ready figures by leveraging the powerful capabilities of Matplotlib and Seaborn, coupled with meticulously designed custom styles and adherence to established best practices.

This templating approach directly addresses the common challenges faced by researchers, such as achieving visual consistency across numerous plots, ensuring accessibility for diverse audiences, and promoting the reproducibility of scientific results. By providing modular Python functions for common plot types, centralized .mplstyle files for aesthetic control, and an interactive Jupyter notebook for practical examples, the repository empowers mechanical engineers to streamline their figure generation workflow. This systematic framework moves beyond ad-hoc scripting, enabling the creation of figures that are not only aesthetically superior but also scientifically rigorous and easily replicable. Ultimately, this resource aims to enhance the clarity, impact, and trustworthiness of scientific communication within the mechanical engineering domain, contributing to more efficient research dissemination and collaboration.
